# MTM Risk Stratification System

> An interpretable clinical decision-support prototype that identifies patients at high risk for medication-related problems and prioritizes them for Medication Therapy Management (MTM) interventions.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a Health Informatics practicum. It combines a validated rule-based clinical scoring engine with machine learning models to produce interpretable, actionable MTM risk classifications for simulated patient populations.

The system is designed to demonstrate how clinical decision support tools can be built transparently — prioritizing explainability and clinical validity over black-box complexity.

## What the System Does

- Ingests and cleans patient-level medication and clinical data
- Engineers clinically meaningful features (polypharmacy flags, adherence risk, comorbidity burden)
- Scores each patient using a validated weighted risk formula (Model C)
- Assigns risk tiers (Low / Medium / High) using percentile-based thresholds
- Applies safety rule overrides to catch clinically obvious high-risk cases
- Generates a plain-language explanation of each patient's top risk drivers
- Recommends a specific MTM intervention action per patient
- Trains and evaluates two ML models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest)
- Combines ML outputs into an ensemble probability score
- Flags patients where models disagree for human review
- Displays all results in an interactive multi-tab Streamlit dashboard

## Models Used

| Model | Type | ROC-AUC | Tier Agreement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rule-based (Model C) | Weighted linear scoring | Baseline | Baseline |
| Logistic Regression | Supervised ML | 0.998 | 86% |
| Random Forest | Ensemble ML | 0.995 | 68% |
| Ensemble (LR + RF) | Averaged probability | — | 77% |

### Why Logistic Regression
Interpretable coefficients allow direct clinical explanation of feature influence. Widely used in validated clinical risk scores (CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc). Appropriate complexity for 4 features and 800 patients.

### Why Random Forest
Detects non-linear feature interactions that logistic regression misses. Provides independent feature importance scores that can be compared against LR coefficients. More robust to edge cases.

### Why Ensemble
Averages LR and RF probability outputs to produce a more balanced estimate. Reduces the impact of individual model biases. Patients where all models agree are flagged as high-confidence classifications.

## Feature Importance

Both models independently agreed on feature ranking:

| Feature | LR Coefficient | RF Importance | Clinical Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| last_hospital | +4.422 | 0.418 | Recent hospitalization is the strongest risk signal |
| adherence_score | −3.017 | 0.272 | Higher adherence strongly reduces risk |
| med_count | +2.697 | 0.194 | More medications increases risk |
| comorbidity_count | +1.761 | 0.116 | More chronic conditions increases risk |

## Dashboard

The Streamlit dashboard has three tabs:

**Overview & Clinical Depth**
- Summary metrics including all-model agreement rate
- Risk tier distribution, age distribution, clinical factor averages
- Adherence vs risk score scatter plot
- Hospitalization rate by tier
- High-priority patient table

**ML Insights**
- Model performance comparison
- Probability distribution histograms for all three models
- LR vs RF probability scatter plot
- Feature importance comparison table
- Disagreement case deep-dive table

**Patient Detail**
- Color-coded risk badge and agreement indicator
- Four gauges: rule-based score, LR probability, RF probability, ensemble probability
- Patient vs population average chart
- Risk explanation and MTM recommendation
- Full model comparison with consensus alert

## How to Run Locally

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mtm-risk-stratification.git
cd mtm-risk-stratification
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Run the pipeline** (in Google Colab or locally)

Open `main_pipeline.py` and run all cells. This generates `data/scored_data.csv`.

**4. Launch the dashboard**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Data

All data used in this project is **fully synthetic**, generated programmatically using a custom mock data generator. No real patient data was used at any stage. The generator produces clinically realistic distributions with intentional noise to simulate real-world edge cases.

**Dataset:** 800 simulated patients  
**Features:** age, medication count, adherence score, comorbidity count, recent hospitalization, HbA1c  
**Noise:** 25% of patients assigned intentional clinical edge-case patterns to create realistic model disagreement

---

## Important Limitations

- **Synthetic data only.** Real-world clinical performance cannot be assumed.
- **Proxy labels.** ML models are trained on expert-defined rule-based labels, not independent clinical outcomes. This is a recognized approach in clinical AI prototyping and is acknowledged transparently throughout the project.
- **Not for clinical use.** This is a practicum prototype for educational and portfolio purposes only.
